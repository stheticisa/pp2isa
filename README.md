During this practice, the following Python topics were covered:
Home
Getting Started
Syntax
Comments
Variables
Data Types
Numbers
Casting
String
Description
This practice focuses on the fundamentals of Python programming. It introduces basic syntax rules, variable usage, data types, and working with numbers and strings.
Purpose
The goal of this practice is to understand how Python works at a basic level and to build a foundation for further learning.

Practice-02 — Control Flow & Boolean Logic
Topics covered:
- If / else statements
- Short-hand (ternary) conditions
- Boolean values (True, False)
- Comparison operators
- Logical operators (and, or, not)
- Operator precedence
- for loops
- while loops
- break and continue
- Range function
- Basic condition-based program logic
Goal: To understand decision making, loop control, and logical expressions in Python.
